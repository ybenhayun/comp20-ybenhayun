This is the readme file for Web Programming, assignment 3. 
All aspects of the assignment have been implented correctly, to the best of my
knowledge, except for the output when using POST /sendLocation (The brackets were
converted to forward slashes for some unidentifiable reason in the JSON string).
I had collaborated and discussed the project with Chase Crumbaugh, to figure out
the logic and syntax needed for server.js. This was completed over the course of 
several days (say about 10 hours).
