This is the readme document for lab 6 in Web Programming, redline. In this
lab the google map has been implemented correctly to the page, but the 
redline actually won't show up on the map due to JavaScript's Same Origin 
Policy. The code in the assignment is entirely my own. This assignment 
took me several hours to complete.
