COMP 20 Fall 2014 Private Repo for Yuval BenHayun
This is a repository for all assignments in Web Programming following and including lab4. 


##Lab 9
The purpose for this repository, as stated above, is for all assignments and labs in Web Programming following and including lab4. My favorite assignment was the newsfeed lab, because it helped me understand how websites manage to keep track of so much information and how website in general are able to store information indefinitely. Since day 1 of this course I have learned 3 separate languages, understood the web as a whole, and learned the relationship between the client and the server. The most important thing I learned was the importance of User Interfaces, and security issues that could exist in one's web application. Now that I've finished the course, I might like to delve deeper into security as I think it's really interesting.
