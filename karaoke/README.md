This is the readme file for lab5, karaoke. The project has been correctly 
implemented and annotates the correct lyrics depending on the timestamp of
the video. I worked on the assignment with Chase Crumbaugh to figure out 
specifics on javascript syntax. This project took a handful of hours to 
complete.
