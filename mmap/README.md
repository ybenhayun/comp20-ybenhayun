This the readme document for assignment 2. Much of the function has not been implemented correctly due to issues in figuring out how to handle the parsed JSON data and display it on the google maps. That being said, I tried to write functions for the algorithms that I did understand despite the lack of functionality. I was able to determine my own location and display it on the map, but implementations past that were difficult. I worked on this assignment over the course of several days. Additionally, I made most of my commits to the ybenhayun.github.io repository, since that was the only way I was able to view the assignment with my location displayed.
