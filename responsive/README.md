This assignment is an responsive web page, that changes based on the width
 of the screen. There are only two files, and index.html and a 
 responsive.css that changes the image on the screen depending on the size
 of the window. All aspects of the assignment have been correctly
 implemented, and all the work in the assignment is my own. This project 
 took a couple hours to complete.
