	<h5>1) Introduction</h5>
	<p> This assesment tests the security of the whereintheworld web application devloped by <a> @yzhang </a> for Comp 20 Assignment 4. This assignment was to act as the server for our Marauder's Map assignment, so it would store the lattitude and longitude of users after they sent their lattitude and longitude to the server, and would give you the option to see all of the location checkins for a specific user. But vulnerabilities and security issues exist in the web application that make it not quite ready for public use. </p>
