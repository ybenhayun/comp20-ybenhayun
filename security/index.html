<title>Security - Assignment 4</title>
</head>

<body>

	<h5>1) Introduction</h5>
	<p> This assesment tests the security of the whereintheworld web application devloped by <a> @yzhang </a> for Comp 20 Assignment 4. This assignment was to act as the server for our Marauder's Map assignment, so it would store the lattitude and longitude of users after they sent their lattitude and longitude to the server, and would give you the option to see all of the location checkins for a specific user. But vulnerabilities and security issues exist in the web application that make it not quite ready for public use. </p>

	<p>In this report, I have detailed out four of the security issues that I have found in my partner's web application.</p>

	<h5>2) Methodology</h5>
	<p>I found all errors that existed in my partner's code by using curl, and by testing his heroku app locally. With these methods I managed to find several issues. </p>

	<h5>3) Abstract Findings</h5>
	<p>The issues that I found were as follows: the web application did not try to validate your location, so you could put yourself anywhere else in the world, it also failed to protect the privacy of other users so you could see everyone else's information, certain hacks would also cause the heroku app to redirect to random webpages, and the database could have easily been overflowed if it was given too much information.</p>

	<h5>4) Issues Founds</h5>
	<p> a) Isssue
		b) Location
		c) Severity of Issue
		d) Description of Issue
		e) Proof of Vulnerability
		f) Resolution			
		</p>

	<h5>5) Conclusion</h5>
	<p>Here, we can see some of the problems that exist with my partner's code. Some things to take into consideration for future projects: location validation, privacy of other users, domain name sustainability (ie. doesn't redirect you to other pages if a user's name was web link), and limiting the size of the mongo database.</p>
